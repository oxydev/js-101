// Remote repository -> github/gitlab

//Local repository ->  our project files in our workstation


Staging area -> the files which are added after adding and before the commit message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to follow for adding a repo to Remote

git init -> Initialize git in project

// Make changes to your file
git add file_name -> Add files to staging area

//After adding the files we add a commit message to let us know what we did
git commit -m "Your message goes here" -> Add commit message

//We add remote repository url to push our project to git stations (github/gitlab/bitbucket)
//Origin is the shortcut for getting the url 
git remote add origin url_for_remote_repo -> Adds the remote link to origin variable

// To list all the remote repository's urls
git remote -v 


//To push the project to remote repository
git push origin master -> master is the name of the branch that we want to pull to local 


//To pull changes comitted in remote repository
git pull origin master -> master is the name of the branch that we want to pull to local
